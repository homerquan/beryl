### Install dependencies

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit download:

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower && npm install && bower install
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

- Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
- npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
- gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
- bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1)  Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```
The version should be at or above 8.x.x

2)  If you don't have Node.js installed

3)  Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh

```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.



### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
npm run dev
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download ***JDK*** and install it.

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Debug

In console, typing in simulation events:

* ``PubSub.publish("debug_simulate",{"event":"show_overlay_tour","payload":"Are you interested in participate our early adoption program?"})``
* ``PubSub.publish("debug_simulate",{"event":"change_thinking","payload":true})``
* ``PubSub.publish("debug_simulate",{"event":"change_training","payload":true})``
* ``PubSub.publish("debug_simulate",{"event":"add_message","payload":{"event":"create_message", "data":{"id":"abc","modelName":"message","source":"ai","text":"test","acknlwedged":true,"type":"language"}}})``
* ``PubSub.publish("debug_simulate",{"event":"show_overlay_highlight","payload":{"el":".g-logo-helium","message":"highlight something"}})``

## Application Theming & Styling

Polymer 1.0 introduces a shim for CSS custom properties. We take advantage of this in `app/styles/app-theme.html` to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file.

[Read more](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling.html) about CSS custom properties.

### Styling
1. ***main.css*** - to define styles that can be applied outside of Polymer's custom CSS properties implementation. Some of the use-cases include defining styles that you want to be applied for a splash screen, styles for your application 'shell' before it gets upgraded using Polymer or critical style blocks that you want parsed before your elements are.
2. ***app-theme.html*** - to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file.
3. ***shared-styles.html*** - to share styles between elements and index.html.
4. ***element styles only*** - styles specific to element. These styles should be inside the `<style></style>` inside `template`.

  ```HTML
  <dom-module id="my-list">
    <template>
      <style>
        :host {
          display: block;
          background-color: yellow;
        }
      </style>
      <ul>
        <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{items}}">
          <li><span class="paper-font-body1">{{item}}</span></li>
        </template>
      </ul>
    </template>
  </dom-module>
  ```

These style files are located in the [styles folder](app/styles/).

## Unit Testing

Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience.

[Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#html-suites) about using Web Component tester.

## Dependency Management

Polymer uses [Bower](http://bower.io) for package management. This makes it easy to keep your elements up to date and versioned. For tooling, we use npm to manage Node.js-based dependencies.

Components installed by Bower live in the `app/bower_components` directory. This location is specified by the `.bowerrc` file. Many projects which follow Yeoman conventions place the `bower_components` directory outside of the `app` directory and then mount it using a server. This causes problems for tools like [Vulcanize](https://github.com/polymer/vulcanize) and [web-component-shards](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/web-component-shards) which rely on relative paths. We've chosen to simplify things and have `bower_components` live inside of `app` to resolve these issues.

## Deploy
TBD

## Licensing
